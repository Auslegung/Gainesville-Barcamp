    <h1>What is Gainesville Barcamp?</h1>
    <p>And just raise cain. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. Working it up and down, back and forth. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect.</p>
    <p>Trees grow however makes them happy. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so.</p>
