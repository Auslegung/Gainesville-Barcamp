      <h1>What is Gainesville Barcamp?</h1>
      <p>
        At BarCamp, you don’t have to be an expert to give a talk, you just
        have to be passionate.
      </p>
      <p>
        There isn't a predetermined speaker list or a bunch of people in suits
        passing out business cards. You can expect more of the crowd you're used
        to: A developer in a tee shirt talking about using apps to home-brew
        beer, a photographer sharing their community art project they started,
        a barista teaching you how to crochet, a startup owner with great
        tips on creating an awesome work environment, and everything in between.
      </p>
      <p>
        BarCamp is a chance to network, learn something new, and communicate what
        you're most passionate about. Come one, come all. No boring talks to
        sift through in order to get to the good ones; the power is totally in
        your hands to hear what you're interested in!  
      </p>
